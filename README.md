# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
This Project focuses on predicting whether a credit card applicant will default or not in the next 12 months, based on credit history and other data about the applicant


Credit card default prediction is important because it can help credit card issuers manage their risk and support customers who are at high risk of defaulting on their payments. This can help protect the issuer's financial health and support customers in managing their debt.


In this project, data has been pre-processed post and models have been built, which have then been trained, to identify the best model, which has then been further tuned and cross-validated to better fit the given training data and make accurate prediction on the test data.
